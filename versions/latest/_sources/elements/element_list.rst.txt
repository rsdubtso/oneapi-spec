- :ref:`oneDPCPP-section`: oneAPI's core language for programming
  accelerators and multiprocessors. DPCPP allows developers to reuse
  code across hardware targets (CPUs and accelerators such as GPUs and
  FPGAs) and tune for a specific architecture
- :ref:`oneDPL-section`: A companion to the DPC++ Compiler for
  programming oneAPI devices with APIs from C++ standard library,
  Parallel STL, and extensions.
- :ref:`oneDNN-section`: High performance implementations of
  primitives for deep learning frameworks
- :ref:`oneCCL-section`: Communication primitives for scaling deep
  learning frameworks across multiple devices
- :ref:`l0-section`: System interface for oneAPI languages and libraries
- :ref:`oneDAL-section`: Algorithms for accelerated data science
- :ref:`oneTBB-section`: Library for adding thread-based parallelism
  to complex applications on multiprocessors
- :ref:`oneVPL-section`: Algorithms for accelerated video processing
- :ref:`oneMKL-section`: High performance math routines for science,
  engineering, and financial applications
