A ``task_arena`` class represents a place where threads may share and execute tasks.

The number of threads that may simultaneously execute tasks in a ``task_arena`` is limited by its concurrency level.

Each user thread that invokes any parallel construction outside an explicit ``task_arena`` uses an implicit
task arena representation object assosiated with the calling thread.

The tasks spawned or enqueued into one arena cannot be executed in another arena.

.. note::

    The ``task_arena`` constructors do not create an internal task arena representation object.
    It may already exist in case of the "attaching" constructor, otherwise it is created
    by explicit call to ``task_arena::initialize`` or lazily on first use.

Member types and constants
--------------------------

.. cpp:member:: static const int automatic

    When passed as ``max_concurrency`` to the specific constructor, arena
    concurrency will be automatically set based on the hardware configuration.

.. cpp:member:: static const int not_initialized

    When returned by a method or function, indicates that there is no active ``task_arena``
    or that the ``task_arena`` object has not yet been initialized.

.. cpp:struct:: attach

    A tag for constructing a ``task_arena`` with attach.

Member functions
----------------

.. cpp:function:: task_arena(int max_concurrency = automatic, unsigned reserved_for_masters = 1)

    Creates a ``task_arena`` with a certain concurrency limit (``max_concurrency``).
    Some portion of the limit can be reserved for application threads with ``reserved_for_masters``.
    The amount for reservation cannot exceed the limit.

    .. caution::

        If ``max_concurrency`` and ``reserved_for_masters`` are
        explicitly set to be equal and greater than 1, oneTBB worker threads will never
        join the arena. As a result, the execution guarantee for enqueued tasks is not valid
        in such arena. Do not use ``task_arena::enqueue()`` with an arena set to have no worker threads.

.. cpp:function:: task_arena(const task_arena&)

    Copies settings from another ``task_arena`` instance.

.. cpp:function:: explicit task_arena(task_arena::attach)

    Creates an instance of ``task_arena`` that is connected to the internal task arena representation currently used by the calling thread.
    If no such arena exists yet, creates a ``task_arena`` with default parameters.

    .. note::

        Unlike other constructors, this one automatically initializes
        the new ``task_arena`` when connecting to an already existing arena.

.. cpp:function:: ~task_arena()

    Destroys the ``task_arena`` instance, but the destruction may not be synchronized with any task execution inside this ``task_arena``.
    Which means that an internal task arena representation associated with this ``task_arena`` instance can be destroyed later.
    Not thread safe w.r.t. concurrent invocations of other methods.

.. cpp:function:: void initialize()

    Performs actual initialization of internal task arena representation.

    .. note::

        After the call to ``initialize``, the arena parameters are fixed and cannot be changed.

.. cpp:function:: void initialize(int max_concurrency, unsigned reserved_for_masters = 1)

    Same as above, but overrides previous arena parameters.

.. cpp:function:: void initialize(task_arena::attach)

    If an instance of class ``task_arena::attach`` is specified as the argument, and there exists
    an internal task arena representation currently used by the calling thread, the method ignores arena
    parameters and connects ``task_arena`` to that internal task arena representation.
    The method has no effect when called for an already initialized ``task_arena``.

.. cpp:function:: void terminate()

    Removes the reference to the internal task arena representation without destroying the
    task_arena object, which can then be re-used. Not thread safe w.r.t. concurrent invocations of other methods.

.. cpp:function:: bool is_active() const

    Returns ``true`` if the ``task_arena`` has been initialized, ``false`` otherwise.

.. cpp:function:: int max_concurrency() const

    Returns the concurrency level of the ``task_arena``.
    Does not require the ``task_arena`` to be initialized and does not perform initialization.

.. cpp:function:: template<F> void enqueue(F&& f)

    Enqueues a task into the ``task_arena`` to process the specified functor and immediately returns.
    The ``F`` type shall meet the `Function Objects` requirements from [function.objects] ISO C++ Standard section.
    The task is scheduled for eventual execution by a worker thread even if no thread ever explicitly waits for the task to complete.
    If the total number of worker threads is zero, a special additional worker thread is created to execute enqueued tasks.

    .. note::

        The method does not require the calling thread to join the arena; i.e. any number
        of threads outside of the arena can submit work to it without blocking.

    .. caution::

        There is no guarantee that tasks enqueued into an arena execute concurrently with
        respect to any other tasks there.

    .. caution::

        An exception thrown and not caught in the functor results in undefined behavior.

.. cpp:function:: template<F> auto execute(F&& f) -> decltype(f())

    Executes the specified functor in the ``task_arena`` and returns the value returned by the functor.
    The ``F`` type shall meet the `Function Objects` requirements from [function.objects] ISO C++ Standard section.

    The calling thread joins the ``task_arena`` if possible, and executes the functor.
    Upon return it restores the previous task scheduler state and floating-point settings.

    If joining the ``task_arena`` is not possible, the call wraps the functor into a task,
    enqueues it into the arena, waits using an OS kernel synchronization object
    for another opportunity to join, and finishes after the task completion.

    An exception thrown in the functor will be captured and re-thrown from ``execute``.

    .. note::

        Any number of threads outside of the arena can submit work to the arena and be blocked.
        However, only the maximal number of threads specified for the arena can participate in executing the work.
