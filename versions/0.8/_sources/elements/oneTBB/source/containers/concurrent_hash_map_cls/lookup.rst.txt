find
----

    .. code:: cpp

        bool find( const_accessor& result, const key_type& key ) const;

        bool find( accessor& result, const key_type& key );

    If the accessor ``result`` is not empty - releases the ``result``.

    If an element with the key equal to ``key`` exists - sets the ``result`` to provide access
    to this element.

    **Returns**: ``true`` if an element with the key equal to ``key`` was found, ``false`` otherwise.

count
-----

    .. code:: cpp

        size_type count( const key_type& key ) const;

    **Returns**: ``1`` if an element with the key equal to ``key`` exists, ``0`` otherwise.
