oneAPI Elements
===============

In the following sections, we define the elements of oneAPI in more
detail. They are the DPC++ language and libraries that use DPC++ to
offload computation to an accelerator. The libraries provide
domain-specific algorithms covering artificial intelligence (AI), high-
performance computing (HPC), analytics, video processing, and
cross-domain libraries for parallel algorithms and threading.

oneAPI elements include:

.. include:: element_list.rst

For each element, we give an overview of the functionality, provide
detailed information on the APIs, and provide links to tests and open
source implementations.
