Range

**[req.range]**

A `Range` can be recursively subdivided into two parts. Subdivision is done by calling
*splitting constructor* of `Range`. There are two types of splitting constructors:

* Basic splitting constructor. It is recommended that the division be into nearly equal parts
  in this constructor, but it is not required. Splitting as evenly as possible typically yields
  the best parallelism.
* Proportional splitting constructor. This constructor is optional and can be omitted.
  When using this type of constructor, for the best results, follow the given proportion
  with rounding to the nearest integer if necessary.

Ideally, a range is recursively splittable until the parts represent portions of work that
are more efficient to execute serially rather than split further. The amount of work represented
by a Range typically depends upon higher level context, hence a typical type that models a
Range should provide a way to control the degree of splitting. For example, the template class
:doc:`blocked_range <../../algorithms/blocked_ranges/blocked_range_cls>`
has a *grainsize* parameter that specifies the biggest range considered indivisible.

If the set of values has a sense of direction, then by convention the splitting constructor
should construct the second part of the range, and update its argument to be the first part
of the range. This enables :doc:`parallel_for <../../algorithms/functions/parallel_for_func>`,
:doc:`parallel_reduce <../../algorithms/functions/parallel_reduce_func>` and
:doc:`parallel_scan <../../algorithms/functions/parallel_scan_func>` algorithms,
when running sequentially, to work across a range in the increasing order, typical of an ordinary sequential loop.

Since a Range declares a splitting and copy constructors, the default constructor for it will not
be automatically generated. You will need to explicitly define the default constructor or add any
other constructor to create an instance of Range type in the program.

A type `R` meets the `Range` if it satisfies the following requirements:

-----------------------------------------------------

**Range Requirements: Pseudo-Signature, Semantics**

.. cpp:function:: R::R( const R& )

    Copy constructor.

.. cpp:function:: R::~R()

    Destructor.

.. cpp:function:: bool R::empty() const

    True if range is empty.

.. cpp:function:: bool R::is_divisible() const

    True if range can be partitioned into two subranges.

.. cpp:function:: R::R( R& r, split )

    Basic splitting constructor. Splits ``r`` into two subranges.

.. cpp:function:: R::R( R& r, proportional_split proportion )

    **Optional**. Proportional splitting constructor. Splits ``r`` into two subranges in accordance with ``proportion``.
