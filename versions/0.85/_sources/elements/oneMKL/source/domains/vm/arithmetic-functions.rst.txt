Arithmetic Functions
====================


.. container::


   Arithmetic functions perform the basic mathematical operations like
   addition, subtraction, multiplication or computation of the absolute
   value of the vector elements.

   -  `add <add.html>`__
      Performs element by element addition of vector ``a`` and vector
      ``b``.
   -  `sub <sub.html>`__
      Performs element by element subtraction of vector ``b`` from
      vector ``a``.
   -  `sqr <sqr.html>`__
      Performs element by element squaring of the vector.
   -  `mul <mul.html>`__
      Performs element by element multiplication of vector ``a`` and
      vector ``b``.
   -  `mulbyconj <mulbyconj.html>`__
      Performs element by element multiplication of vector ``a`` element
      and conjugated vector ``b`` element.
   -  `conj <conj.html>`__
      Performs element by element conjugation of the vector.
   -  `abs <abs.html>`__
      Computes absolute value of vector elements.
   -  `arg <arg.html>`__
      Computes argument of vector elements.
   -  `linearfrac <linearfrac.html>`__
      Performs linear fraction transformation of vectors ``a`` and ``b``
      with scalar parameters.
   -  `fmod <fmod.html>`__
      The fmod function performs element by element computation of the
      modulus function of vector ``a`` with respect to vector ``b``.
   -  `remainder <remainder.html>`__
      Performs element by element computation of the remainder function
      on the elements of vector ``a`` and the corresponding elements of
      vector ``b``.
