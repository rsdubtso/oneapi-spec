Matrix Storage
==============


.. container::


   The oneMKL BLAS and LAPACK routines for DPC++ use several matrix and
   vector storage formats. These are the same formats used in
   traditional Fortran BLAS/LAPACK.

      .. rubric:: General Matrix
         :name: general-matrix
         :class: sectiontitle


      A general matrix ``A`` of ``m`` rows and ``n`` columns with
      leading dimension ``lda`` is represented as a one dimensional
      array ``a`` of size of at least ``lda`` \* ``n``. Before entry in
      any BLAS function using a general matrix, the leading ``m`` by
      ``n`` part of the array ``a`` must contain the matrix ``A``. The
      elements of each column are contiguous in memory while the
      elements of each row are at distance ``lda`` from the element in
      the same row and the previous column.

      A triangular matrix ``A`` of ``n`` rows and ``n`` columns with
      leading dimension ``lda`` is represented as a one dimensional
      array ``a``, of a size of at least ``lda`` \* ``n``. The elements
      of each column are contiguous in memory while the elements of each
      row are at distance ``lda`` from the element in the same row and
      the previous column.

      -  If ``upper_lower = uplo::upper``, the leading ``n`` by ``n``
         upper triangular part of the array ``a`` must contain the upper
         triangular part of the matrix ``A``. The strictly lower
         triangular part of the array ``a`` is not referenced. In other
         words, the matrix

         triangular part of the array ``a`` is not referenced. That is,

      A general band matrix ``A`` of ``m`` rows and ``n`` columns with
      ``kl`` sub-diagonals, ``ku`` super-diagonals, and leading
      dimension ``lda`` is represented as a one dimensional array ``a``
      of a size of at least ``lda`` \* ``n``.


      Before entry in any BLAS function using a general band matrix, the
      leading (``kl`` + ``ku`` + 1\ ``)`` by ``n`` part of the array
      ``a`` must contain the matrix ``A``. This matrix must be supplied
      column-by-column, with the main diagonal of the matrix in row
      ``ku`` of the array (0-based indexing), the first super-diagonal
      starting at position 1 in row (``ku`` - 1), the first sub-diagonal
      starting at position 0 in row (``ku`` + 1), and so on. Elements in
      the array ``a`` that do not correspond to elements in the band
      matrix (such as the top left ``ku`` by ``ku`` triangle) are not
      referenced.
